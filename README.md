# Automated Classification System for Diabetic Retinopathy using Capsule Autoencoder

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is an eye condition that can cause damage to retinal blood vessels and blindness in people who have diabetes for a prolonged period of time. DR is one of the leading causes of blindness among adults around the world. Normally, retinal screening examinations on all diabetic patients are done manually by highly skilled experts.

The main objective is to develop an automated classification system to diagnose and classify the high resolution fundus retinal images and provide information on the severity. We will be using Capsule Network to train the model and for classification we will be using autoencoder.
